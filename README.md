🏦 Banking Data Analytics Project
📊 Overview
This project explores and analyzes key metrics from a banking dataset using a combination of Excel, Power BI, Python, DAX, and SQL. The aim is to derive actionable insights and visualize business performance, customer behavior, and financial trends through an interactive dashboard.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Excel: Data preprocessing and cleaning; final touch-ups for Power BI dashboard.

Power BI: Visualizing insights, creating calculated columns/measures using DAX, and publishing the interactive dashboard.

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Exploratory data analysis and transformation in Jupyter Notebook.

SQL Workbench/J: Data querying, joins, aggregations, and filtering — integrated with Python via Jupyter.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Custom metrics and logic within Power BI.
